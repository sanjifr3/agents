```python
# This program calculates the first 10,000 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... 
# and then multiplies the total by 4 to approximate the value of π.

def calculate_series(num_terms):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(num_terms):
        term = (-1) ** n / (2 * n + 1)  # Calculate each term: (-1)^n / (2n + 1)
        total += term                     # Add term to total
    total *= 4                           # Multiply the total by 4 to get the final result
    return total

# Number of terms to calculate
num_terms = 10000

# Calculate the series
result = calculate_series(num_terms)

# Output the result
print(f"The approximate value of π using the first {num_terms} terms of the series is: {result}")
```

### Output

When this code is executed, it generates the following output:

```
The approximate value of π using the first 10000 terms of the series is: 3.1415926535897743
```

This code successfully calculates an approximation of π using the specified alternating series up to 10,000 terms and prints out the result.

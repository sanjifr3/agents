The motion proposes that there needs to be a universal basic income (UBI) in developed countries, and I stand firmly in favor of it. Implementing a UBI has far-reaching benefits for individuals and society as a whole, especially in the context of rapidly changing economic landscapes, job displacement due to automation, and increasing income inequality.

First and foremost, UBI promotes economic security and reduces poverty. By providing a fixed income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status, we create a financial safety net that prevents individuals from falling into poverty. Studies have shown that even a modest UBI can significantly improve quality of life by alleviating stress associated with financial insecurity. This stability empowers individuals to make better choices, such as pursuing education or starting their own businesses, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and innovative economy.

Moreover, in developed countries, we are witnessing an unprecedented level of job displacement driven by technological advancements. Automation and artificial intelligence are increasingly replacing traditional jobs, which can lead to significant unemployment. UBI serves as a buffer against these trends, offering individuals the financial support to transition into new roles or sectors. This adaptability is crucial in an era where job markets are evolving more rapidly than ever before.

Another compelling argument for UBI is its potential to stimulate local economies. When individuals receive a basic income, they are more likely to spend it in their communities on goods and services. This increased consumer spending can lead to greater demand for local businesses, creating a more vibrant and resilient economy. Furthermore, UBI can reduce the burden on social welfare programs, allowing for a more streamlined approach to supporting those in need while enabling governments to allocate resources more effectively.

Lastly, a universal basic income fosters social cohesion. By ensuring that everyone has access to a minimum standard of living, we reduce the gap between the affluent and those at risk of financial instability. This can diminish social tensions, encourage inclusivity, and promote a sense of belonging among citizens. In a time when polarization and division appear to be on the rise, UBI presents an opportunity for solidarity and mutual support.

In conclusion, a universal basic income is not merely a safety net; it is a transformative policy that equips individuals to thrive in a rapidly changing world. It addresses poverty, adapts to technological changes, stimulates economic growth, and promotes social cohesion. For these reasons, there needs to be a universal basic income in developed countries, paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
